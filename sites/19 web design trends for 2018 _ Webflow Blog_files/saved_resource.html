Independent journalism IS flourishing under Trump. Check out Disobedient Media if you need another example. We now have people motivated by the desire for accurate and well researched journalism thanks to the "anti-Trump at all costs" mainstream.</p><p>I agree with your last comment as well regarding why politics was injected into a design article at all...unfortunately, that has also become a trend. Anti-Trump rhetoric is included awkwardly in almost all aspects of media consumption and it's killing many formats. Need an example? NFL. Need I say more.</p><p>A tip I would've included in this list is to keep politics out of any content which is not directly related to politics, including this type of article. I know I'm sick of it and have stopped reading many pieces at that point. I completely abandoned Nano-wri-mo this year due to an inexplicable email I received prior to the event discussing the "horrors of the new Trump Presidency". I was so disgusted, I can't recall why it was even included and what it's point was supposed to be.</p><p>My design tip--unless you are writing about politics specifically, keep your political leanings out of the design and the content. Period.</p></div></div><span class="post-media"><ul data-role="post-media-list"></ul></span></div></div><a class="see-more hidden" title="see more" data-action="see-more">see more</a></div><footer
